    We definitely don't need the full IW API, so depending on this library makes no sense, especially since it is still alpha and not yet packaged in Debian.

In hotspot_login_manager/libs/daemon/hlm_daemonize_psf.py:
    Most code in this module has been borrowed from python-daemon 1.5.5 by Ben Finney et al. (which is licensed under the PSF v2).

    Unfortunately this library is not yet ported to Python 3, so I (syam) ported and refactored it to fit my needs.
