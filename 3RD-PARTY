In hotspot_login_manager/libs/linux/hlmp_wifi.py:
    Most code in this module has been borrowed from python-wifi 0.5.0 by Roman Joost / Sean Robinson (which is also licensed under GPL).

    We definitely don't need the full IW API, so depending on this library makes no sense, especially since it is still alpha and not yet packaged in Debian.
