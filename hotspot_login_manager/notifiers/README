This directory contains executable programs that are used as notifier backends for unpriviledged users.
See option --notifier.

Whatever executable program that is dropped here will appear in the available backends.
When a notification happens, HLM will call the selected backend with the notification message as the first argument.

If you happen to use a notification system that is not already provided by HLM, please notify us so we can add it!
And if you can write the code it's even better: a new unknown environment is always a hassle to install and configure
so the priority will probably be low for us, while your working code will get included quite fast.
